    <p>Who doesn't love a good puff pastry app? These cheesy, fruity bites are perfect to serve during the winter holidays.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese</li>
        <li>cooking spray/li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>½ cup cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard rind from Brie cheese. Place cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it easier to cut.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, oil a 24-cup mini muffin pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Roll puff pastry sheet out into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Cut sheet lengthwise into 4 even strips and then crosswise into 6 even strips, making 24 squares. Separate squares and gently press each one into a prepared muffin cup.</li>
        <li>Remove chilled Brie from the freezer; cut into 24 pieces, approximately 3/4-inch in size.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon cranberry sauce to each pastry-lined muffin cup, then press in a piece of Brie and top with 1 teaspoon chopped walnuts. Season each bite with a pinch of sea salt. Transfer muffin pan to the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes, or cover and chill for up to 3 days. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake bites in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve warm, and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
